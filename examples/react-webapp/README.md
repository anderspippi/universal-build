# Example Webapp

Summary description of the webapp goes here...

## Usage of this Template

The Sections below explain the used style guides and configurations for this project.

## Develop

This project uses [React](https://reactjs.org) as the main framework. Components should be written as [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) instead of the old class-style wherever possible. See [Section Components Guide](#components-guide) for some more guidelines. For component styling this project uses the [styled-components library](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) (see [Section Component Styling](#component-styling)). As the default design we use [Material](https://material.io/design) and, hence, the [Material-UI Library](https://material-ui.com).

For code styling, [eslint](https://eslint.org) is used for linting and [prettier](https://prettier.io) is used for formatting (see [this page](https://prettier.io/docs/en/comparison.html) for learning about linting vs. formatting). The linting rules are listed in [.eslintrc.js](./eslintrc.js). The configuration for prettier can be found in [.prettierrc](./prettierrc). The configurations adhere to [Airbnb's JavaScript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). For CSS styling, [stylelint](https://stylelint.io) is used for which the configuration can be found in the [.stylelintrc.json](./.stylelintrc.json) file.

Docs should be written in [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/about-getting-started.html) format, though overall we advocate self-explanatory code over comments.

It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (`yarn create react-app react-webapp`) and, thus, uses the pre-configured webpack and babel build tools.

The used package manager for installing packages is [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable).

It uses Storybook (see [Section](#storybook)) for documenting components. For more information about testing, check [this Section](#testing).

> All `yarn` commands in this documentation can be executed via `yarn container` to run it inside of the development container instead of using the host. Hereby, the current directory is mounted into the container. See the `yarn container` command in the [package.json](./package.json).

### Code Style

When contributing code, please try to make the code following the project's codestyle setup as described in the [Development summary section](#develop). We recommend to use plugins in your IDE to already keep an eye on the style while developing.
After executing `yarn install` as they are defined in the [./package.json](./package.json), you can run style checking like following:

- Formatting:
  - `yarn run prettier <path-to-file>`: this command formats the file and saves it.
- Linting (shows the problems but does not fix them):
  - `python build.py --check` runs all checks as defined in the [build.py](./build.py) or manually:
  - `yarn run lint:js`: checks the JavaScript files (files ending with `.js`/`.jsx`).
  - `yarn run lint:css`: checks the `.css` files.

Sometimes, you have to do something that is not allowed by the linting rules. For example, property spreading in React makes sense sometimes. In this example, you can disable the linter for the specific line by adding `// eslint-disable-line react/jsx-props-no-spreading`. Instead of disabling a rule globally, this forces you to think about your decision instead of allowing slopiness by default.

### Build

#### Production Build

Execute `python build.py --make` to build the app. Under the hood, it uses `yarn build` for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### Local Development Build and Run

Execute `yarn start` to run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Development Walkthrough

> Add some information here about the structure of the app, what the entrypoint is, and what tools are used.

#### Project Structure

The project uses follwing structure:

- `src/`: Contains the source code of the web app, for example the React components. Development usually happens in here. The `/src/index.jsx` is the entry point into the application.
- `public/`: Contains the default public resources that must be available such as the `index.html`. It also contains the `locales/` directory for translation files other than English; see the [Internationalization Section](#internationalization) for more information.
- `build/`: The generated directory that contains the bundled web app. This folder is ignored by `git` and should not be pushed
- `node_modules/`: The installed packages. This folder is ignored by `git` and should not be pushed.

Inside of the `src/` folder, there should be following structure (inspired by this [blog post](https://www.devaradise.com/react-project-folder-structure)):

- `components/`: Capsulated components appear here. Artifacts that are specific to a component should be packaged together, for example `components/dashboard/` should have all components and styles and images that are just relevant for the `dashboard` component (domain-based structure).
- `pages/`: Reflects the routes of the application and is composed of different components. Each component in this folder should have its own route. If a page has specific components that are only used within that page (especially those which are composed of more general components), you can add them in a sub-directory here instead of the `components/` directory.
- `utils/`: Functionality that is generally relevant for your application and could be used in multiple places.
- `app/`: Contains app essentials such as routes and the store in form of `store.js` [when using Redux](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts).
- `services/`: Contains JavaScript functions and clients that manage API integrations.
- `assets/`: Should contain style and images and other resources that are generally relevant for your application and not only for a specific component.
- `stories/`: Contains general Storybook files such as introduction and assets that are not directly linked to a specific component. It should not contain the actual component stories.

If files belong together, for example a component has a related `.stories.jsx` and `.test.jsx` file, put them into an extra folder. Also, when needed add an `index.js` file to a component directory to make it easier to import as shown [here](src/pages/App/index.js).

Add Storybook files (see the [Storybook Section](#storybook)) next to the components they describe. Story files must follow the `<component-name>.stories.jsx` name pattern. For example, if you have a component `src/dashboard/Dashboard.jsx`, put the stories file under `src/dashboard/Dashboard.stories.jsx`.

Add test files next to the code they are testing (see the [Testing Section](#testing)). Test files must follow the `<component-name>.test.jsx` name pattern.

#### Component Styling

You can find an example of how [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) can be used [here](./src/components/Button.jsx#L5). With the stated [motivation](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#motivation) of the library, the style of a component should be bundled with the component and, usually, lies in the same file.

#### Components Guide

##### Arrow Functions

Inside of functional components, we prefer [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) `const foo = () => {}` over function declarations `function foo(){}`.

##### Memoized Functions

In class components, arrow functions should be defined outside of the `render` function to avoid [any performance problems](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-functions.html#arrow-function-in-render). For functional components, define non-component specific functions outside of the component function or use `useMemo`/`useCallback` functions to avoid re-creation of functions (see [this example](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56477027/5379273) and the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo)).

##### Memoized Components

When your component uses components that render often and always with the same props, consider using a memoized version of those components via `React.memo` to avoid unnecessary re-renders (check out [this blogpost](https://dmitripavlutin.com/use-react-memo-wisely/)).

#### Internationalization

We use the [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com) ([GitHub](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next)) library for translations. The translation file for languages other than English is loaded dynamically upon need via the [i18next-http-backend](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-http-backend) library. The translation files are placed under [./public/locales](./public/locales). Add a new folder there for extending the languages or edit the languages there to add new translations. The [English translation](./src/en.json) file is pre-bundled with the app which is why it is placed under the `src/` directory.
You can find an example of how to use the `i18next` in [./src/pages/App/App.jsx](./src/pages/App/App.jsx#L11).

#### Storybook

When we want to document our components further than using JSDoc, we use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction). In the [Stories directory](./src/stories/) you can find some example stories (this project was initialized via `npx sb init`).  
The Storybook server can be started via `yarn run storybook`.

#### Testing

This project uses [Jest](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests) and [react-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) for testing as it comes pre-bundled with _Create React App_.
The official Jest documentation recommends to add at least smoke tests to make sure that components render ([source](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests#testing-components)), so we go along with this recommendation ;)
Use `test()` instead of it's alias `it()` ([source](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api.html#testname-fn-timeout)). See the [App.test.jsx](./src/App.test.jsx) file for an example.

To run the tests, execute `yarn test`. To see test coverage, execute `yarn test -- --coverage` ([source](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/#coverage-reporting)).

### Installed Packages

Please have a look at the [package.json](https://github.com/mltooling/project-template/blob/react-webapp/react-webapp/package.json) and check whether the dependencies for react, react-scripts etc. should be updated. Also, check whether package updates influence some configuration files such as the configuration of [.storybook](./.storybook).

### VS Code

- For the settings, have a look at the _Web Development_ Section of our [Recommended Settings](https://github.com/mltooling/project-template/blob/main/.vscode/recommended-settings.json).
- For recommended extensions, have a look at the _General Development_ and _Web Development_ Sections of our [Extensions list](https://github.com/mltooling/project-template/blob/main/.vscode/extensions.json).
- For JSDoc, no extension is needed as it is [built in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/javascript#_jsdoc-support). Just type `\**` and autocomplete. When using types in the comment, VS Code even considers the typing.
- Sometimes, linting errors don't disappear even though you seem to have fixed them. Close the file and re-open it to see whether the error persists.

### Create React App

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
